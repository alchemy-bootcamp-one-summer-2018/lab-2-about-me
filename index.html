    <h1>Mike Bennett: The Game</h1>
    <h2>But first, a little bit about me:</h2>
        <p>Hello there! My name is Michael, but to be honest, no one really calls me that. 
        <br>I've managed to earn the name Mike, as most Mikes do. I've had the pleasure of
        <br>working lots of different jobs since entering the work force.
    </p>

        <p>Now that you know a little bit about my career choices, I can tell you more about
        <br>my life! I was born in Cape Cod, Massachusetts in the summer of 1988. After growing
        <br>up on the cape, I eventually moved to Central Pennsylvania. Despite the obvious shift in
        <br>environment, I ended up genuinely enjoying my time there. While in Pennsylvania, I attended
        <br>Shippensburg University and graduated with a degree in Studio Arts/Illustration. After making some
        <br>not so wonderful career choices, I eventually moved to Portland, Oregon in early 2016.
