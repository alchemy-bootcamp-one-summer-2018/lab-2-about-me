    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <blockquote>Hi there! I'm Ron. I recently moved from St. Louis, Missouri about a month and a half ago, driving across the country to attend ACL!
            I've worked in IT the past few years, my past couple of roles being in Systems Administration (SysAdmin).
            I've also had brief work experience for a startup, primarily using Python for their web application 
            Presently, I'm working at Bellagios Pizza some nights, and weekends while attending boot camp during the day.   
            Some of my favorite foods include Steak, Ramen, any sort of BBQ... and I LOVE candy. At this point, I've completed
            most of 3 college degrees or so. I love Science, Engineering and Math, but have found the employment prospects for
            these to be less appealing than advertised. My nearest term goal is to use the next half year+ practicing and studying
            to re-enter the workforce as a full-stack developer.</blockquote>
